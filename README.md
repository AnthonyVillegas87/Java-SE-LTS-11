# Java-SE-LTS-11


Overview
Java 11 is designated as the LTS or Long Term Support version of Java - it's going to 
be supported by Oracle & JDK vendors until at least 2026, unlike Java 9, 10, 11,
12, 13, 14, 15, etc. all of which are supported by Oracle.
Large companies have large code bases, and it takes them a long to upgrade with a more recent version.
Majority of the industry will be moving, or already moved to this version.
Because Java 11 is Oracle's LTS of java, version 11 is one to become more familiar & certified in.
This repository is for that purpose.
