Package and Import Summary

The package statement is used to group classes into a logical set of classes, that have some commonality.

* Only one package can be defined in a .java source file.
* The package statement must be the first line of code(excluding comments and empty lines).
* No package statement makes the class, or type you define, belong to the unnamed package.


 To have the compiler create class files in exploded directories, that represent your package names:

 * use javac -d {directory} foo.java, where {directory} represents the directory you want the package directories to be created ( {.} = . means current working directory).
 * A class file does not have to reside in a directory structure, that represents its package structure.

 To reference a class in a package, you must:

 * Use a Full Qualified Class Name (FQCN)
 * Or include an import statement for the package class name.

 Import statements are used to inform the compiler, where the classes outside the current package, are defined while allowing easier readability.

 You could write all code without a single import statement, using just fully qualified class names, but it is harder to read.

 * You can have 0 to many import statements.
 * Import statements must follow any package statement, and precede any other code, excluding comments and empty lines.
